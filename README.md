# Discord Bot
 Basic Discord Bot

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zilong Dragneel ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Codes

This can be used on local as well as be hosted on Heroku.
This is just a basic example of Discord bot for beginners, feel free use this as a template. You will mostly need to edit the bot.py, and dont forget to add integration package names in requirements.txt if you happen to add any.
There are several ways to add a Discord bot token so you can watch a guide for that.
Use the https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html for more useful commands
